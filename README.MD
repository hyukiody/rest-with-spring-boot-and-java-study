Restful database with SpringBoot STUDY project;

  Based on the "Aprenda Spring Boot framework Swagger Docker Kubernetes K8s API RESTful JWT JUnit 5 Mockito React JS do 0 Ã  AWS e GCP e+", online course by Leandro Costa at Udemy.com;

  This is an analysis project study mirrored on the mentioned online course, which focuses its observations onto the structure and relationship of the libraries being employed and its relationships between abstract layer communications and other examples among these libraries and others employed external libraries;

  This project was completely transcripted by hand while watching the online classes and through the source code provided by the owner of the web course; since I find this the only way for me to assimilate the content, which is manually copying and explaining the code with commentaries. I chose the project for the Spring and MySQL technologies and architecture employed; although while progressing with the classes, the owner added the usage of other cloud hosting platforms which are not the main focus of this  personal study.
  
  Thank you so much for reading.
